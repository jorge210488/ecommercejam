## Description

This is the backend for an individual ecommerce project developed during the Henry bootcamp. It provides a solid API foundation using a modern tech stack to support a fully functional ecommerce platform. The application includes the following technologies:

- **TypeScript**: for static typing and scalable development.
- **NestJS**: to build a modular, maintainable, and robust backend.
- **TypeORM**: for seamless database integration and management.
- **Docker**: for containerization and easy deployment.
- **Swagger**: to document and test the API endpoints.
- **Auth0**: for secure and flexible user authentication.

This backend was designed to offer a comprehensive ecommerce solution, handling product, user, and order management with ease.
